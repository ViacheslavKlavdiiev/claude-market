# Security Policy

## Trust model

Installing a plugin is a single trust decision: one `/plugin install` activates
**all** of its components at once — skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers, and
executables. Hooks and MCP servers run arbitrary code on the user's machine.
Consequently:

- Every plugin README must state what the plugin executes: hooks, MCP servers,
  external binaries, network access.
- Any change that adds or modifies hooks, MCP servers, or executables deserves
  line-by-line review.
- Validation (`claude plugin validate .`) proves well-formedness, **not** safety —
  review is the security gate.

## Secrets policy

- No credentials, tokens, or API keys anywhere in the repository — including
  `.mcp.json`, hook scripts, examples, and tests.
- Plugins that need user credentials must obtain them via `userConfig` fields
  marked `"sensitive": true` or from environment variables, and must document
  which ones.
- Anything that looks like a real secret is grounds for rejection. If a secret is
  committed, it is considered leaked and must be rotated, even if the commit is
  later removed.

## External plugin sources

This marketplace currently ships only local plugins (`plugins/…`). If an external
plugin is ever listed, its source must be pinned with **both** a `ref` (tag) and a
full 40-character commit `sha`, so a moved tag or branch cannot silently change
what users install.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub → **Security** → **Report a
vulnerability** on this repository. Do not open public issues for exploitable
problems.

## Incident response: a dangerous release was published

There is no remote kill switch: users keep the plugin in their local cache
(`~/.claude/plugins/cache`) until they update or uninstall it. The response is
about stopping further installs and shipping a fix fast:

1. **Stop distribution.** Remove or replace the plugin's entry in
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. If the plugin is removed entirely, add it to
   the top-level `renames` map as `"<plugin-name>": null` so existing installs are
   notified.
2. **Ship the fix forward.** Publish a corrected release with a version bump —
   never reuse a version (see [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md)). Users receive it after
   `/plugin marketplace update` + `/plugin update`.
3. **Publish a GitHub Security Advisory** describing impact, affected versions,
   and remediation.
4. **Notify users** in the README and release notes; instruct affected users to
   run `/plugin update <name>@claude-market` or uninstall and reinstall.
5. **Rotate anything exposed** (tokens, keys) and run a post-mortem on how the
   release passed review.
