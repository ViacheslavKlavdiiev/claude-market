# run-plan — spawn-prompt templates

Fill every `{{placeholder}}`; drop a whole block only when marked optional.
Spawn prompts are English; `{{user_language}}` tells the agent what language to
write its report prose in. Embed content VERBATIM (context pack, findings,
design brief) — pass fragments, not pointers.

Agent types are referenced by plain name. `implementer`, `test-writer`,
`implementation-planner`, and `plan-verifier` ship in this plugin
(`sdd-engineering`); `architecture-reviewer` ships in the `architecture-review`
plugin and `researcher` in `research-tools` — both are declared dependencies.
If the host requires plugin-qualified agent types, qualify accordingly.
Stack surface skills (paved-path + library) are never hardcoded by framework
name in these templates: spawn prompts that write surface code tell the agent
to load the paved-path and library skills the Stack Manifest lists for this
surface (see [stack-manifest.md](stack-manifest.md), shipped alongside this
file), resolving the actual skill ids and namespaces from the manifest at
spawn time.

## 1. implementer — phase (Stage 1)

Agent: `implementer`, name `impl-p{{N}}`. One per phase; parallel within a wave.
Single-agent mode reuses this SAME template with one agent whose "phase" is
the whole plan: keep the targeted-tests clause below VERBATIM — "your slice"
then means the test files of the tasks being implemented, NEVER the full
package suites (those stay the green barrier's job).

```
Implement Phase {{N}} — "{{phase_title}}" of the Development Plan
{{plan_path}}.

Execution context (run-plan pipeline; your report goes to an orchestrator):
- Your phase, verbatim from the plan:
{{phase_block_verbatim}}
- Disjoint scope — you own ONLY these files/modules; do not touch anything else:
{{disjoint_scope}}
- Shared scaffold (context pack) — use these fragments; do NOT re-read their sources:
{{context_pack_verbatim}}
{{#if additional_prompt}}- Additional requirements from the user:
{{additional_prompt}}{{/if}}
{{#if design_brief}}- Design brief (verbalized from designs; images are NOT available to you):
{{design_brief}}{{/if}}

Rules for this run:
- Load the paved-path and library skills the Stack Manifest lists for this
  surface (see references/stack-manifest.md) before writing any surface-specific
  code; if the manifest is absent, fall back to `CLAUDE.md` prose or proceed
  stack-neutrally.
- Write code + tests for YOUR tasks ({{task_ids}}); a separate test-writer pass
  will fill remaining RTM test gaps afterwards — do not stray beyond your tasks.
- Run ONLY the targeted tests of your slice (the test files of YOUR tasks and
  the files you touched — the project's test runner scoped to a path/pattern),
  NOT the full package suite: the full suite is the green barrier's job
  (Stage 3). This narrows your standard Definition of Done for this run —
  "targeted tests green" is enough.
- Do NOT tick plan checkboxes, do NOT commit/push, do NOT run database
  migrations (flag if one becomes required).
- Report in your standard completion-report format, prose in {{user_language}}.
```

## 2. test-writer — gap pass (Stage 2)

Agent: `test-writer`, name `test-gap-pass`. One per run, after the last wave.

```
Test gap pass for the Development Plan {{plan_path}} (run-plan pipeline).

The implementation phases are complete. Audit the plan's Traceability matrix
Test column against the tests that ACTUALLY exist on disk:

{{rtm_table_verbatim}}

- Shared scaffold (context pack) from the plan, VERBATIM — use these fragments
  instead of re-reading their source files:
{{context_pack_verbatim}}
- For every RTM test with no existing (or only superficial) coverage, write it.
- Do NOT rewrite healthy tests the implementers already added; extend only
  where coverage of the mapped AC is missing or thin.
- Run ONLY the test files you added/extended, NOT the full package suites: the
  full suite is the green barrier's job (Stage 3). This narrows your standard
  Definition of Done for this run — "the tests you touched are green" is enough.
- Production files changed in this run (for orientation): {{changed_files}}
- Any production-code change you need → report as a follow-up (it will be
  routed to an implementer); never make it yourself.
- Report in your standard format, prose in {{user_language}}.
```

## 3. architecture-reviewer (Stage 4)

Agent: `architecture-reviewer`, name `arch-review`. Parallel with plan-verifier.

```
Architecture review of the run-plan changes for {{plan_path}}.

Scope: ALL uncommitted changes vs baseline {{baseline_sha}} — `git diff` plus
untracked files ({{changed_files}}). Audit ONLY this scope, not the whole repo.
Context pack from the plan (verbatim fragments of the shared seams — consult
these before re-reading their source files):
{{context_pack_verbatim}}
Report prose in {{user_language}}.
```

## 4. plan-verifier (Stage 4)

Agent: `plan-verifier`, name `plan-verify`. Parallel with architecture-reviewer.

```
Verify the implementation against the Development Plan {{plan_path}}.

The plan was just executed; the changes are uncommitted in the working tree
(changed files: {{changed_files}}). Produce your standard RTM report — audit
the code as it is on disk. Context pack from the plan (verbatim fragments of
the shared seams — consult these before re-reading their source files):
{{context_pack_verbatim}}
Report prose in {{user_language}}.
```

## 5. Fix iteration — implementer (Stage 5)

Prefer `SendMessage` to the owning `impl-p{{N}}` (context warm). Fresh fixer
(`implementer`, name `fix-iter{{K}}-{{group}}`) only when ownership is mixed or
the owner is gone. Same body either way:

```
Fix iteration {{K}} (run-plan pipeline) — findings from review, assigned to you
because they fall in your scope: {{group_scope}}.

Findings VERBATIM (evidence included — address the evidence, not a paraphrase):

{{findings_verbatim_with_evidence}}

Rules: load the paved-path and library skills the Stack Manifest lists for
this surface (see references/stack-manifest.md) before fixing findings in it;
stay inside {{group_scope}}; fix the findings and re-run ONLY the tests
covering {{group_scope}} (the full suite re-runs at the green barrier); do not
tick checkboxes / commit / migrate. Report files changed + test result, prose
in {{user_language}}.
```

## 6. Re-verify delta — SendMessage to a reviewer (Stage 5)

To `arch-review` and/or `plan-verify` — whichever produced the findings. Never
spawn a fresh full audit for a re-check.

```
Fix iteration {{K}} is applied. Re-check ONLY these findings of yours against
the updated working tree: {{finding_refs}}.
Changed since your review: {{delta_files}}.
For each: resolved | still-open (with fresh evidence). Do not re-audit anything
else; do not raise new findings unless the fix itself introduced a violation.
```

## 7. implementation-planner — wave-balance split revision (Pre-flight)

Agent: `implementation-planner`, name `plan-split-rev`. Only when the
wave-balance gate trips.

```
Revise the Development Plan {{plan_path}} (run-plan pre-flight, wave-balance
gate): Phase {{N}} — "{{phase_title}}" is >2× the median size of its wave
siblings ({{size_evidence}}).

Split it into disjoint, parallel-safe sub-phases per your Phase-size balance
rule: non-overlapping Disjoint scope, real dependencies preserved, task IDs
and the Traceability matrix updated in place. Execution mode and all other
phases stay untouched. Edit the plan file in place; report the new phase
layout, prose in {{user_language}}.
```
